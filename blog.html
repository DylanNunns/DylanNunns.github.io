		<h3>Coding with my <a href="https://twitter.com/JessiNunns" target="_blank">Wife</a><br/>
		2016-12-12</h3>
		Currently in my spare time I am teaching my wife programming. We have started with C++. So far we have a small CLI game that you can die by walking into a river, very treacherous! We are working slowly and just building things to learn.<br/>
		We both enjoy playing World of Warcraft and Minecraft together, so one of our future projects may be an Add-on to one of these games.<br/>

		<h3>Saving Time &amp; Money through Boring-Task-Automation<br/>
		2016-12-12</h3>
		When I started at my current employer I went through a new onboarding process of sitting down with different departments for the first week including sales, and support. For the first time in my career I was able to see how archaic some processes were on the other side.<br/>
		Every Monday, my co-worker would sit down and break apart large, several-hundred and sometimes thousand line excel documents into smaller individual reports to email off to people. This would take him 4-6 hours to do, for just one.<br/>
		At the time I was dabbling with Python, and I figured I could make this task much easier for him. It was a pretty simple workflow: Get CSV, Split master CSV into multiple CSVs based off matching values in a single column and save. Easy.<br/>
		So I went to work with the little Python I knew and within 2 days I had a little CLI program that he can run every Monday and now his very long, expensive reporting process now takes him no more than 5 minutes to do.<br/>
		He has since used this script to break up other reports saving him, and the company, hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars in labour each year.<br/>
		It is instances like this that really bring me joy in software development. I love being able to build tools to help other people do their job better, and faster.
