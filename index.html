		Greetings, Adventurer.<br/>
		It appears you have stumbled upon my little nook. Please make yourself welcome and cozy up by the hearth!<br/>
		&#x2744; &#x2744; &#x2744;<br/>
		My name is Dylan. I am a plaid-wearing, snow-loving, dog-chasing Canadian who also happens to have a deep love for Software Development.<br/>
		My Quest is to one day craft and build tools that can enable others to better wield their powers and assist in bringing their ideas to life. I often find my nose buried in tomes and scrolls about Engines, Graphics, Operating Systems, Compilers, Assembly, Networking and Dragons.<br/>
		&#x2744; &#x2744; &#x2744;<br/>
		<h3><i>I am in search for a great company that can offer remote employment!</i></h3>
		I have a huge interest in systems programming, concurrency, sockets, and graphics programming! I enjoy pushing myself past my comfort zone in programming, as well as learning and working with old and new languages. I am also passionate making tools to help people do their jobs.<br/>
		Over the last 3 years I have had the opportunity to work with several different languages in the industry including PHP (incl. Laravel &amp; Symfony), Swift, C++, DirectX, C#, .NET, and SQL.<br/>
		I am available for contact through <a href="https://www.twitter.com/DylanNunns" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:dylan.nunns@gmail.com">Email</a>! Feel free to contact me at any time if you would like to chat, work with me, or if you are a company in search of an employee!
